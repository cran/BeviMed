Description: A fast integrative genetic association test for rare diseases based on a model for disease status given allele counts at rare variant sites. Probability of association, mode of inheritance and probability of pathogenicity for individual variants are all inferred in a Bayesian framework - 'A Fast Association Test for Identifying Pathogenic Variants Involved in Rare Diseases', Greene et al 2017 <doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2017.05.015>.
