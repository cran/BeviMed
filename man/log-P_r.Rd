\title{Calculate marginal probability of observed genotypes under 'pathogenic region' model}
\usage{
"log P_r"(y, G, min_ac = 1L, q_shape = c(2, 4), p_shape = c(1, 1))
}
\arguments{
\item{y}{Logical vector of case (\code{TRUE}) control (\code{FALSE}) status.}

\item{G}{Integer/logical vector of genotypes by individual corresponding to case-control label \code{y} giving the 'rare variant counts'/'presence of rare variant indicators'.}

\item{min_ac}{Minimum allele count per individual to be considered to have a pathogenic combination of variants. '1' could correspond to a dominant inheritance hypothesis whereas '2' could correspond to a recessive inheritance hypothesis.}

\item{q_shape}{Beta shape hyper-priors for prior on rate of affection (i.e. being a case) amongst individuals with non-pathogenic variant combinations (i.e. they have less than \code{min_ac} variants.}

\item{p_shape}{Beta shape hyper-priors for prior on rate of affection (i.e. being a case) amongst individuals with pathogenic variant combinations (i.e. they have at least \code{min_ac} variants.}
}
\description{
Marginal probability calculated exactly by integration.
